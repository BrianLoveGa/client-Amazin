          These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing
          mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new
          civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to
          neutralize the homing signal. Each unit has total environmental
          control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective
          field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced
          chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field strength has increased
          by 3,000 percent.

          in science, the beginning of wisdom, is 'I do not know.' All
          transporters off.
